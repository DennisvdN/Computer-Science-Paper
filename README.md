The project is about duplicate detection methods using locality sensitive hashing and preprossesing of the data
The dataset used for this project is about televisions
Usually the model ID is missing, so detecting duplicated is hard
this project uses the title and important key value pairs to predict duplicates

The code is structured as much as possible with functions
However, due to time constraints the code became very chaotic
You can use the code by loading in the data of your interest
